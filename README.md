# MechPilotPrototype
A Unity prototype / sandbox project

The .zip file contains a built project that is ready to run.

Unpack and run the .exe file -> press Host/Server to start a client as host or dedicated server.

Can run the .exe file again to start another client that joins the first one.

This prototype is not here to show anything cool. It's just an old sandbox project used for learning Unity.
